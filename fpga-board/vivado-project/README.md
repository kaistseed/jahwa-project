Vivado design suite is an integrated design environment (IDE) developed by Xilinx that provides a lot of features such as:

* Vivado high-level synthesis (HLS) compiler which transforms C, C++, and SystemC programs into RTL code.
* Vivado simulator that supports mixed-language simulation and verification.
* Vivado IP integrator that allows the designer to easily integrate and configure IP core either a pre-built library from Xilinx or custom-made IP cores.



### PYNQ Framework

<p align="center">

</p>

PYNQ is an open-source framework from Xilinx that is designed for system designers, software developers, and hardware designers to easily use Xilinx platforms. With the support of Python language and libraries, designers can get the huge benefits of using programmable logic and microprocessors to build more interesting and powerful embedded systems. For now, the PYNQ framework can be used with Zynq, Zynq UltraScale+, Zynq RFSoC, and Alveo accelerator boards.



### Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

Inter-integrated circuit (I2C) is a multi-master, multi-slave, serial communication protocol which is widely used in embedded systems to connect low speed peripheral devices with processors or microcontrollers. I2C protocol uses two bidirectional open collector or open drain lines which are serial data line (SDA) and serial clock line (SCL). These lines are connected with pull-up resistor and typically the resistor is connected to 5V or 3.3V voltage source.

There are four possible configurations of I2C which are:

- `Master transmit`: master device is sending data to slave device.
- `Master receive`: master device is receiving data from slave device.
- `Slave transmit`: slave device is sending data to master device.
- `Slave receive`: slave device is receiving data from master device.

To begin the transaction, master device sends START signal followed by 7-bit address of the slave device, which then followed by single bit representing whether the master wants to write data (0) or read data (1) from slave. If the slave device exists, it will send back ACK signal bit for that address. After receiving ACK signal from slave, master will continue to read or write data from or to slave. The START signal is usually indicated by high-to-low transition of SDA line with SCL being high. Meanwhile, the STOP signal is indicated by a low-to-high transition of SDA with SCL in high [2].

### Installing Vivado

To install Xilinx Vivado on your computer, first, you need to download the installer from the Xilinx website. You can download the software through this link: **https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html** . On the download page, you can choose either the online installer or offline installer. If you choose an offline installer, then the downloaded software can be used in either Linux or Windows operating systems. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="D:\Projects\git-repo\jahwa-project\fpga-board\vivado-project\resources\vivado-install.jpg" alt="vivado-install" width="70%" />
</p>

During the installation process, you need to choose the `Vivado HL Webpack edition` since it doesn't require any license to use the software. If you are using an online installer, please make sure that you have around 40 GB of free space left on your computer since the installer will download a couple of files with a total size of around 35 GB.



### PYNQ Board Setup

In order to set up the PYNQ board, you need to prepare the following items:

* PYNQ Z1 board
* Computer with browser
* Ethernet cable
* Micro USB cable
* Micro SD with a minimum of 8 GB capacity

After preparing those items, the first thing to do is to download the correct PYNQ image file for the board from the following link                                                        **http://www.pynq.io/board.html**. For this tutorial, you will use the PYNQ Z1 board from Digilent. So, download the PYNQ image for the PYNQ Z1 board.

<p align="center">
    <img src="D:\Projects\git-repo\jahwa-project\fpga-board\vivado-project\resources/pynq-download.jpg" width="70%" />
</p>

After downloading the PYNQ Image, flash the image into the SD card using an OS flasher tool such as `Balena Etcher`. You can download Balena Etcher software from **https://www.balena.io/etcher/**. After flashing the PYNQ image to an SD card, now you can try to connect the board to your computer by following the steps below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="D:\Projects\git-repo\jahwa-project\fpga-board\vivado-project\resources/pynq-setup.jpg" width="50%" />
</p>

1.	Set the JP4 jumper to SD position by placing the jumper over the top two pins as in the figure above.
2.	If you use a micro USB cable to supply power to the board, place the JP5 jumper in a USB position. You can also power the board with a 12 V external power supply by configuring the JP5 jumper to REG position.
3.	Insert microSD card with PYNQ image to the micro SD card slot in the bottom of the board.
4.	Connect the micro USB cable to the board and computer.
5.	Connect the board to the network by using an ethernet cable. The connection can be done directly to the computer or via a network router.
6.	Turn on the board and check whether the board is operating correctly by looking at the LED indicator in the board. After turning on the board, RED LD13 LED will turn on immediately indicating that the board has power. Shortly after that, Yellow LD12 LED will also turn on to show up that the board is working correctly. After a minute, two BLUE LD4 & LD5 LED will start flashing to indicate that the system is now booted and ready to use.
7.	To access the PYNQ board via a direct connection, you must set the IP address of your computer to a static IP address in the range of 192.168.2.00 to 192.168.2.255 (except for 192.168.2.99 since it is used by the board).
8.	After setting the IP address, open the browser and enter `192.168.2.99` in the address bar.
9.	If the board is configured correctly, you will see a login screen with a password field in it. The username for the board is `xilinx` and the password is also `xilinx`.

For more detailed information about how the board and how to set up it, you can access the documentation at this link:                                                                 **https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/pynq_z1_setup.html**.



### Create New Vivado Project

First, open up Vivado application and create a new project.
1.	Click next on Create a New Project.
2.	Enter the name of your project, for example, led_chaser.
3.	Select RTL project and click next.
4.	If you already have Verilog source, you can add it in the add source window. Otherwise, just skip the process and click next.
5.	Add board constraint file by choosing pynq_z1.xdc file and make sure to check copy constrains files into project option.
6.	In the board selection section, choose PYNQ-Z1 board if it is available. Otherwise, you should download the PYNQ-Z1 board file and copy the board files folder to `<Xilinx installation directory>\Vivado\<version>\data\xhub\boards\XilinxBoardStore\boards\Xilinx\`                                         (**Note:** for older Vivado version, you can copy the board files to `<Xilinx installation directory>\Vivado\<version>\data\boards`).                                                                     You can find PYNQ-Z1 board files on **https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overlay_design_methodology/board_settings.html**. You need to restart Vivado after copying the board file.

</p>


### Create System Block Diagram

To start this section, make a new Xilinx project for PYNQ Z1 board. Make sure to choose the correct board file during the project creation process. After that, create a new block diagram as in the previous project and also add a `ZYNQ Processing System`. Don't forget to run `Connection Automation` after adding `ZYNQ IP Core`.

In this section, you will create a memory-mapped interface that can be accessed from the Python environment. There are many ways to create a memory-mapped interface. But, for this section, you will use one of the General Purpose AXI Interfaces, specifically `Processing System (PS) AXI Master Ports`.

By default, the `Processing System (PS) AXI Master Ports` is enabled when you are adding `ZYNQ Processing System Core` to the design, but if it’s disabled, you can configure it by double-clicking the `ZYNQ Processing System Core` and under the `AXI Non-Secure Enablement` section in the `PS-PL Configuration`, enable a `General Purpose AXI Master Interface`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/axi-master-config.png" width="60%" />
</p>

After enabling the `AXI Master port` the `ZYNQ Processing System` block diagram should look like the figure below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/5ceb245d80d7923ccb2bec1f2a86b3dcb2e3e36b/02-axi-mmio/resources/zynq-axi-master.png" width="40%" />
</p>



### Adding AXI IIC Interface

In this section, you will add AXI IIC interface to the design. Follow the instruction below to add AXI IIC interface IP core your design:

1. Click `Add IP` button or use (Ctrl + I) keyboard shortcut and search the AXI IIC IP core.

2. Place `AXI IIC` IP core inside your design.

3. Configure IP settings by double-clicking the IP and change `IIC parameters` of the AXI IIC core.

4. In the IIC parameters, you need to change `SCL clock frequency` to match the SCL clock frequency of the sensor or IIC device. In this module, you will use MPU6050 sensor as IIC slave. So, set the SCL clock frequency to `400 KHz`. For other sensors, you can read the sensor datasheet to determine proper SCL clock frequency value.

5. Next step is to adjust the `address mode` and `SDA active state` configuration. For MPU6050 sensor, you need to set `address mode` to `7-bit` since MPU6050 address is 7-bit long and `active state of SDA` to `0`. These configurations depend on the sensor setting. So, make sure to check the sensor datasheet before changing the `AXI IIC IP configuration`.

   <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/axi-iic-ip.png" width="55%" />
   </p>

6. After that, you need to add IIC interface port in order to map the `AXI IIC` core output to the board pins. To add interface port, right click at the block diagram window and click `Create Interface Port` or use `Ctrl+L` keyboard shortcut. In the interface port window, set `interface name`, select `IIC interface`, and set the mode to `Master`. Finally, connect the `newly created interface port` with `IIC port`of AXI IIC IP core.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/axi-iic-port.png" width="30%" />
</p>



### Adding AXI Interrupt Controller

After adding AXI IIC to your design, you also need to add AXI Interrupt Controller and AXI Timer IP core to enable precise timing delay to the design. 

After adding AXI IIC to your design, you also need to add an SPI interface in order to communicate with SPI-based sensor. In this case, you need to add `AXI Quad SPI` IP core. To add the IP core, you can just follow the steps when you add the `AXI IIC` IP core. For AXI Quad SPI core configurations, you just need to `disable STARTUP Primitive` option.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/axi-qspi.png" width="55%" />
</p>
After adding the core, you also need to add the interface port to map AXI Quad SPI core output to the board pins. To add SPI interface port, go to `board` section next to diagram window and find `SPI connector J6`, right click after selecting SPI connector J6, and choose `Auto Connect` option. This step allows Vivado to map existing IP core in the block diagram, in this case `AXI Quad SPI block` with available port in the PYNQ-Z1 board.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/axi-qspi-port.png" width="80%" />
</p>



### Synthesize and Port Mapping Process

After adding both `AXI IIC` IP core and `AXI Quad SPI` IP core, run design automation and validate the design. If there are no errors, then you can generate the block design wrapper and start `synthesizing` the design.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/final-bd.png" width="70%" />
</p>

Before running implementation and bitstream generation process, you need to change the `board pin mapping`, so that the AXI IIC IP core and AXI Quad SPI core inputs and outputs are mapped to correct pins. To change the pin mapping, click `open synthesized design` in the left menu and after synthesized design opens, click `window > I/O ports` option from toolbar.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/io-port-window.png" width="80%" />
</p>

In the I/O ports menu, you need to change board pin mapping as follows:

<div align="center">

| Port Name  | Board Pin Name | Package Pin Name |  I/O Std  |
| :--------: | :------------: | :--------------: | :-------: |
| IIC_scl_io |      SCL       |       P16        | LVCMOS33* |
| IIC_sda_io |      SDA       |       P15        | LVCMOS33* |
| SPI_io0_io |   spi_mosi_i   |       R17        | LVCMOS33* |
| SPI_io1_io |   spi_miso_i   |       P18        | LVCMOS33* |
| SPI_sck_io |   spi_sclk_i   |       N17        | LVCMOS33* |
| SPI_ss_io  |    spi_ss_i    |       T16        | LVCMOS33* |

</div>

After changing the pin mapping, save the constraint, resynthesize the design and start generating design bitstream.



### Run Design on PYNQ Board

After generating bitstream, you need to connect the sensor to PYNQ board before you can run and test the design. For this module, you will connect MPU6050 sensor to the board via IIC interface. Meanwhile, SPI interface is used to connect BME280 sensor with PYNQ board. If you connect those sensors directly without Arduino shield, you can follow the schematic below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/sensor-no-shield.png" width="40%" />
</p>

Otherwise, just plug the Arduino shield with sensors to the PYNQ Arduino pin header.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/91db9570a2c6f66e5b13f714534b07b04eb42133/03-digital-sensor/resources/sensor-shield.png" width="40%" />
</p>

Once you connect the sensors, export the bitstream file and block diagram file and upload them to the PYNQ board, you need to create a new notebook and write Python code to control the behavior of your custom AXI memory-mapped interface. 

The first thing you need to do is to import the required `PYNQ library`, [pybme280](https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/b92d1f3470d12a6fab190918205a11a8bdf126c2/03-digital-sensor/pybme280.py) and [pympu6050](https://github.com/kaistseed/intro-to-xilinx-fpga/blob/b92d1f3470d12a6fab190918205a11a8bdf126c2/03-digital-sensor/pympu6050.py) library, and load the `overlay`. You can also check which IP core is connected to your system by using printing `ip_dict` variable from your overlay class. 

```python
# Import library
import cffi
import math
import time
import numpy as np
import datetime as dt
from pynq import Overlay
from pynq.lib.iic import AxiIIC

# Import library for MPU6050 and BME280 sensor
from pybme280 import *
from pympu6050 import *

# Import overlay
ol = Overlay("./multi_sensor_swapped.bit") # Filename might be different
# Print IP core list
print(ol.ip_dict)
```

When you check the IP core list by printing `ip_dict` variable, you will get a result similar to the result below.

```python
{'axi_iic_0': {'phys_addr': 1096810496, 'addr_range': 65536, 'type': 'xilinx.com:ip:axi_iic:2.0', 'state': None, 'interrupts': {}, 'gpio': {}, 'fullpath': 'axi_iic_0', 'mem_id': 'SEG_axi_iic_0_Reg', 'device': <pynq.pl_server.device.XlnkDevice object at 0xb02b0650>, 'driver': <class 'pynq.lib.iic.AxiIIC'>}, 'axi_quad_spi_0': {'phys_addr': 1105199104, 'addr_range': 65536, 'type': 'xilinx.com:ip:axi_quad_spi:3.2', 'state': None, 'interrupts': {}, 'gpio': {}, 'fullpath': 'axi_quad_spi_0', 'mem_id': 'SEG_axi_quad_spi_0_Reg', 'device': <pynq.pl_server.device.XlnkDevice object at 0xb02b0650>, 'driver': <class 'pynq.overlay.DefaultIP'>}}
```

Next step is to assign controller to each IP core by using the code below

```python
# Instantiate i2c controller
spi_control = ol.axi_quad_spi_0
i2c_control = ol.ip_dict['axi_iic_0']
```

After that, basically you can access both of the sensor using SPI and I2C protocol by writing command to the AXI quad SPI and AXI IIC IP core. For this module, you will be given libraries which contain function to write and read data to sensor using SPI and I2C protocol. So, you don’t need to write the function for SPI and I2C transactions.

To test the I2C protocol, first you want to check whether the MPU6050 can receive the data from PYNQ board by using code below. The code below initialize communication with MPU6050 sensor and set initial sensor parameter.

```python
# Declare AXI I2C Instance
AXII2C = AxiIIC(i2c_control)
MPUI2C = MPU6050(AXII2C, MPU6050_SCALE_2000DPS, MPU6050_RANGE_2G)
```

Then, you can do MPU6050 sensor calibration using the code below

```python
# Calibrate sensor
MPUI2C.calibrateGyro(100)

# Set threshold
MPUI2C.setThreshold(3)

# Check sensor settings
# Check sleep mode
print("Sleep mode: {}".format("Enabled" if (MPUI2C.getSleepMode()) else "Disabled"))

# Check clock source
clk_source = MPUI2C.getSensorClock()
if (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_KEEP_RESET):
    print("Clock source: Reset mode")
elif (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_EXTERNAL_19MHZ):
    print("Clock source: External 19.2 MHz clock")
elif (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_EXTERNAL_32KHZ):
    print("Clock source: External 32.768 MHz clock")
elif (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_PLL_XGYRO):
    print("Clock source: X-axis gyroscope reference")
elif (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_PLL_YGYRO):
    print("Clock source: Y-axis gyroscope reference")
elif (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_PLL_ZGYRO):
    print("Clock source: Z-axis gyroscope reference")
elif (clk_source == MPU6050_CLOCK_INTERNAL_8MHZ):
    print("Clock source: Internal 8 MHz oscillator")
else:
    print("Invalid clock source")
    
# Check gyroscope scale
gyro_scale = MPUI2C.getSensorScale()
if (gyro_scale == MPU6050_SCALE_250DPS):
    print("Gyroscope scale: 250 dps")
elif (gyro_scale == MPU6050_SCALE_500DPS):
    print("Gyroscope scale: 500 dps")
elif (gyro_scale == MPU6050_SCALE_1000DPS):
    print("Gyroscope scale: 1000 dps")
elif (gyro_scale == MPU6050_SCALE_2000DPS):
    print("Gyroscope scale: 2000 dps")
else:
    print("Invalid gyroscope scale setting")
    
# Check gyroscope offset
gyro_x_offset = MPUI2C.getGyroOffsetX()
gyro_y_offset = MPUI2C.getGyroOffsetY()
gyro_z_offset = MPUI2C.getGyroOffsetZ()
print("Gyroscope offset X: {} - Y: {} - Z: {}".format(gyro_x_offset, gyro_y_offset, gyro_z_offset))
```

After calibration, you can try to read some data from sensor. For example, you can read raw gyroscope data using code below

```python
while(1):
    # Get normalized gyroscope readings
    MPUI2C.getRawGyro()
    # Print result
    print("X-axis: {}, Y-axis: {}, Z-axis: {}".format(MPUI2C.raw_gyro["x_axis"], MPUI2C.raw_gyro["y_axis"], MPUI2C.raw_gyro["z_axis"]))
    # Delay
    time.sleep(0.25)
```

For the BME280 sensor with SPI interface, you can test the sensor using code below

```python
# Declare BME280 controller
BMESPI = BME280(spi_control, 0, 0)

# Check power mode
bme_mode = BMESPI.getSensorMode()
print("Sensor mode: {0:b}".format(bme_mode))

# Get sensor configuration
BMESPI.getSensorConfig()
# Print sensor configuration
print("Sensor Humidity Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["humid_osr"]))
print("Sensor Pressure Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["pres_osr"]))
print("Sensor Temperature Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["temp_osr"]))
print("Sensor Filter Coefficient: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["filter_coef"]))
print("Sensor Standby Time: {}\n".format(BMESPI.settings["stby_time"]))

# Set sensor configuration
BMESPI.settings["pres_osr"] = BME280_OVERSAMPLING_1X
BMESPI.settings["temp_osr"] = BME280_OVERSAMPLING_16X
BMESPI.settings["humid_osr"] = BME280_OVERSAMPLING_2X
BMESPI.settings["filter_coef"] = BME280_FILTER_COEFF_16
BMESPI.settings["stby_time"] = BME280_STANDBY_TIME_62_5_MS

# Print sensor configuration
print("User Humidity Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["humid_osr"]))
print("User Pressure Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["pres_osr"]))
print("User Temperature Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["temp_osr"]))
print("User Filter Coefficient: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["filter_coef"]))
print("User Standby Time: {}\n".format(BMESPI.settings["stby_time"]))

# Set sensor configuration settings selector
settings_sel = BME280_OSR_PRESS_SEL
settings_sel |= BME280_OSR_TEMP_SEL
settings_sel |= BME280_OSR_HUM_SEL
settings_sel |= BME280_STANDBY_SEL
settings_sel |= BME280_FILTER_SEL

# Write sensor configuration to slave device
BMESPI.setSensorConfig(settings_sel)
# Set sensor power mode
BMESPI.setSensorMode(BME280_NORMAL_MODE)

# Check power mode
bme_mode = BMESPI.getSensorMode()
print("Sensor mode: {0:b}".format(bme_mode))

# Get sensor configuration
BMESPI.getSensorConfig()
# Print sensor configuration
print("Final Humidity Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["humid_osr"]))
print("Final Pressure Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["pres_osr"]))
print("Final Temperature Oversampling: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["temp_osr"]))
print("Final Filter Coefficient: {}".format(BMESPI.settings["filter_coef"]))
print("Final Standby Time: {}\n".format(BMESPI.settings["stby_time"]))

# Get sensor calibration data
BMESPI.getCalibData()

# Get data from sensor
while(True):

## :question: [Practice] Postprocessing Sensor Data 

For practice, you can write a program to do following things:

- Read accelerometer data from MPU6050 sensor and plot the result.
- Get Pitch, Yaw, and Roll data from MPU6050 sensor and plot the result.
- Change BME280 sensor configuration such as oversampling ratio and compare the data with initial configuration. It is better if you can plot both data in one chart.

For plotting data, you can use any kind of libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn. You can also take a look at sensor datasheet `BME280`: **https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/7/3/b/1/BME280_Datasheet.pdf** and `MPU6050`: **https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Register-Map1.pdf**. 

For other example program, you can find at this GitHub link `MPU6050`: **https://github.com/jarzebski/Arduino-MPU6050** and `BME280`: **https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library**. In the GitHub link, all of the example code and libraries are written in C. So, you need to write equivalent program in Python. But, you don’t need to write all of the function because you will be given a source code containing both MPU6050 and BME280 function written in Python language.
